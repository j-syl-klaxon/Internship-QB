1. Prerequisites:
    -Download Git Terminal
    -Sign up to Github.

2. To make a new repository on Github with folders, etc.:
    
    -"ls"(to look at directory)
    - "cd ...." (change directory to ..Folder Name.. and go further)
    - "../../../" (go 3 times back from present folder)

    Attack pattern: Open Git Terminal, ls, cd Documents, ls (to check), cd 1st Folder, ls, cd 2nd Folder (if I want all files in 2nd Folder)

    Then:
        -use "git init" (creates empty repository)
        -create new repository on Github (with desc. and README if possible.)
        -use "git remote add origin 'https:// link Github gives you' " on Git terminal (links local, empty git repo with remote repo)
        - "git status"
        - "git add -A"
        - "git status"
        - "git commit -m "Some rand msg"
        - "git push -u origin master" 

3. To send changes to remote repository (repo):
    -Trawl through Directory via Git Terminal & (ls, cd, ../)
    - "git status"
    - "git add -A" (if adding modified files)
    - "git status" (to check - green files)
    - "git commit -m "Msg to describe change." (to save the files fully and to bundle & push)
    - "git push" (to send it off)


4. To make pull requests to others to change repositories.
    - "Create a branch"
    - "git pull 'the_branch'"
    - "git checkout 'the_branch'"
    - Follow No. 3...
    - "git push 'the_branch'"
    - Change made in remote branch
    - Make pull request and submit...
    - Owner of repo says its good and will merge the branch and the master file.

5. Delete Files or Folders in Github...
    - Click on File (not Folder) in Remote repo
    - Look for "Trash" icon.
    - Delete File from website.

OR 
    - Delete File/Folder manually in Windows' Explorer/ Mac's Finder
    - Follow No. 3
